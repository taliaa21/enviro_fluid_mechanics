Grad Course, CE 200B – Environmental Fluid Mechanics II

Course Description: Learned turbulence and turbulence modeling, advection-diffusion scalar transport equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations for idealized and realistic cases relevant to the environment. Topics included channel and boundary layer flows, stratified flows, sediment transport, irrotational flows, surface waves and waves in basins.
